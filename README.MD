# Mathematical Programming for Anomaly Analysis of Clafer Models - Supplementary Material

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper _Mathematical Programming for Anomaly Analysis of Clafer Models_. The tool implementation of our approach for anomaly detection of Clafer models using mathematical programming techniques is called _Boundanalyzer_.

Overview of directories:
* `subj_systems` - contains the Clafer model files of the subject systems.
* `eval` - contains the raw output that is used for analysis of the subject systems and, additionally, scripts to generate the tables used in the paper.
* `run_eval` - contains the scripts to reproduce results from experiments.
* `tool` - contains the binary that was used to produce the evaluation results.
